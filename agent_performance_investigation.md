# Agent Performance Investigation - Critical Performance Issues

## Executive Summary
**CRITICAL**: Agent queries are experiencing severe performance degradation with response times 10-50x above acceptable thresholds (12-35 seconds vs 1 second target).

## Performance Metrics
- **Simple Queries**: 12,228.5ms average (10,227.8-16,056.8ms range)
- **Complex Queries**: 35,577.7ms average (15,922.8-51,909.2ms range)
- **Threshold**: 1,000ms (all queries exceed by 10-50x)
- **Success Rate**: 100% (functionality works, but extremely slow)

## Current Configuration Context
- **Model**: `gpt-4.1-nano` (line 38 in config/config.yaml)
- **Environment**: All external services (Plex, Radarr, Sonarr, TMDb) performing excellently
- **Integration**: Agent uses trace_agent.py subprocess execution
- **Timeout**: 60 seconds (queries completing within timeout but extremely slow)

## Investigation Clues & Observations

### 1. Subprocess Execution Overhead
- **Pattern**: Agent queries use subprocess calls to `trace_agent.py`
- **Overhead**: Each query spawns new Python process
- **Metadata**: Shows stdout_length 1,924-5,808 characters (substantial output)
- **Hypothesis**: Process spawning + serialization overhead

### 3. Tool Call Patterns
- **External Services**: All performing excellently (Plex: 7-51ms, TMDb: 32-48ms)
- **Agent Integration**: Only component showing severe slowdown
- **Hypothesis**: Multiple sequential tool calls or inefficient orchestration

### 4. Response Variability
- **Simple vs Complex**: 3x performance difference (12s vs 35s)
- **Variability**: High standard deviation suggests inconsistent performance
- **Hypothesis**: Complex queries may trigger multiple tool calls or longer reasoning chains

## Investigation Plan

## Key Files to Investigate
- `scripts/trace_agent.py` - Main agent execution script
- `config/config.yaml` - Model configuration (line 38)
- `llm/clients.py` - LLM client implementation
- `bot/tools/` - Tool implementations and registry
- `bot/workers/` - Worker implementations

## Success Criteria
- **Target**: Reduce agent query response time to <5 seconds
- **Stretch Goal**: Achieve <2 second response times
- **Maintain**: 100% success rate and functionality

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Current performance makes system unusable for real-time interaction
- **Medium Risk**: Subprocess elimination may require architectural changes
- **Low Risk**: Tool call optimizations and caching should be safe

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate (Phase 1.1)**: Add granular timing instrumentation to trace_agent.py
