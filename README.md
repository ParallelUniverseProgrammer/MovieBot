---

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose (for containerized setup)
- OR Python 3.8+ (for local development)
- Discord Bot Token and Application ID
- At least one LLM key: `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
- Plex, Radarr, Sonarr, and TMDb API keys (as needed)

### 2. Install

**Option A: Docker (Recommended)**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd MovieBot

# Create an environment file (.env) ‚Äî see "Configuration" below for keys
# Edit .env with your API keys

# Build and run
docker compose up -d
```

**Option B: Local Python**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd MovieBot

python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
.venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure with the Setup Wizard

**Option A: One‚ÄëCommand Setup (Recommended)**
```bash
./setup_env_and_start.sh
```

**Option B: Manual Setup**
```bash
python main.py
```

The setup process is a **two‚Äëstep helper**:

1. **`setup_env_and_start.sh`**  
   - Checks Python version and dependencies  
   - Activates your virtual environment  
   - Validates your environment configuration  
   - Attempts to run the setup wizard if needed  
   - Starts the bot  

2. **`setup_wizard.py`**  
   - Interactive TUI (or simple prompts if TUI isn‚Äôt available)  
   - Collects API keys and preferences  
   - Creates config files safely (never overwrites `.env`)  
   - Initializes household defaults  

üí° If `.env` already exists, changes are written to `.env.wizard.suggested` for you to review. If your shell script cannot launch the wizard on your system, run `python main.py` once to complete setup, then start the bot.

---

### 4. Run the Bot

**Option A: Using the setup script (Recommended)**
```bash
./setup_env_and_start.sh
```

**Option B: Direct execution**
```bash
python -m bot.discord_bot
# or
python -m bot
```

You‚Äôll see logs like `Starting bot...` or `üîó Sonarr client initialized ...` when it‚Äôs working.  
Leave it running ‚Äî press `Ctrl-C` to stop.

For troubleshooting:
```bash
MOVIEBOT_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG python -m bot.discord_bot
```

---

## üí¨ Using MovieBot in Discord

1. **Enable Intents**  
   In the Discord Developer Portal ‚Üí Your App ‚Üí Bot:  
   - Enable *Message Content Intent*  
   - Give permissions: *Send Messages*, *Read Message History*  

2. **Invite the Bot**  
   In Developer Portal ‚Üí OAuth2 ‚Üí URL Generator:  
   - Select scopes: `bot`, `applications.commands`  
   - Choose minimal permissions (Send Messages, Read Message History, Use Slash Commands)  
   - Copy the generated URL and invite the bot to your server  

3. **Faster Development Sync**  
   - Set `DISCORD_GUILD_ID` in `.env` for near‚Äëinstant slash command sync  
   - Without it, global sync can take up to ~1 hour  

4. **First Check**  
   - Use `/ping` to confirm the bot is alive  
   - In servers: mention the bot or use slash commands  
   - In DMs: just message it directly  

---

## üê≥ Docker Setup

MovieBot is fully containerized for easy deployment and sharing.

### Quick Docker Start
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <repository-url>
cd MovieBot

# Create your environment file (.env) and add keys from the Configuration section

# Build and run
docker compose up -d

# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# Stop
docker compose down
```

### Docker Environment Variables

```

### Sharing Your Dockerized MovieBot

**Option 1: Docker Hub**
```bash
# Build and push to Docker Hub
docker build -t yourusername/moviebot:latest .
docker push yourusername/moviebot:latest

# Others can run with:
docker run -d --name moviebot \
  -v ./config:/app/config \
  -v ./data:/app/data \
  --env-file .env \
  yourusername/moviebot:latest
```

**Option 2: GitHub Container Registry**
```bash
# Build and push to GitHub
docker build -t ghcr.io/yourusername/moviebot:latest .
docker push ghcr.io/yourusername/moviebot:latest
```

**Option 3: Share Repository**
Others can simply clone and run:
```bash
git clone your-repo
cd MovieBot
touch .env  # Fill in their values (see Configuration)
docker compose up -d
```

### Docker Notes
- The container runs as root to avoid Windows bind mount permission issues
- Config and data are persisted via volume mounts (`./config` and `./data`)
- No ports are exposed (Discord connects outbound only)
- Use `host.docker.internal` for local service URLs on Windows/Mac

---

## üîß Configuration

### Environment (`.env`)
```bash
# Discord
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_bot_token
APPLICATION_ID=your_application_id
DISCORD_GUILD_ID=optional_dev_guild_id

# OpenAI / OpenRouter
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key
OPENROUTER_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
OPENROUTER_SITE_URL=https://your-site-or-repo-url
OPENROUTER_APP_NAME=MovieBot

# Plex
PLEX_BASE_URL=http://localhost:32400
PLEX_TOKEN=your_plex_token

# Radarr
RADARR_BASE_URL=http://localhost:7878
RADARR_API_KEY=your_radarr_key

# Sonarr
SONARR_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8989
SONARR_API_KEY=your_sonarr_key

# TMDb
TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_key

# Logging
MOVIEBOT_LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

**Required:**  
- Minimal to run the bot: `DISCORD_TOKEN`, `PLEX_TOKEN` + `PLEX_BASE_URL`, and either `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`.  

**Optional (enables more features):**  
- `RADARR_API_KEY`, `SONARR_API_KEY`, `TMDB_API_KEY` (for discovery and automated adds)  
- `DISCORD_GUILD_ID`, `APPLICATION_ID` (faster command sync and richer presence)  

Note: The interactive setup helper (`python main.py`) validates a fuller configuration and expects OpenAI + Radarr + Sonarr + TMDb before declaring setup ‚Äúcomplete.‚Äù If you prefer a minimal config (e.g., Plex-only or OpenRouter), start the bot directly with `python -m bot.discord_bot`.

---

### Runtime (`config/config.yaml`)

**Minimal config:**
```yaml
household:
  displayName: Household
radarr:
  qualityProfileId: 1
  rootFolderPath: "D:\\Movies"
sonarr:
  qualityProfileId: 4
  rootFolderPath: "D:\\TV"
```

**Full example available in the repo** with advanced tuning for LLMs, caching, retries, and UX.

---

## üß† Smart Household Preferences

MovieBot learns what your household likes and adapts over time:

- **Genres** ‚Äî remembers your favorite themes and aesthetics  
- **People** ‚Äî actors, directors, creators you love  
- **Constraints** ‚Äî runtime sweet spots, language, content warnings  
- **Anti‚Äëpreferences** ‚Äî what to avoid (e.g. shaky‚Äëcam, found footage)  

You can query and update preferences:
```bash
@MovieBot "What genres do we like for horror movies?"
@MovieBot "Add Pedro Pascal to our favorite actors"
@MovieBot "Recommend something similar to The Matrix but more recent"
```

---

## üé≠ How It Works

1. Discord messages ‚Üí processed by the agent  
2. Agent selects the right LLM role (chat, smart, quick, worker)  
3. Agent queries tools (Plex, Radarr, Sonarr, TMDb) with bounded, configurable parallelism  
4. Two‚Äëphase execution: read first, then perform writes with a quick validation read  
5. Results are streamed back to Discord (with progress indicators)  

User ‚Üí Agent ‚Üí Tools ‚Üí (optional) Writes ‚Üí Streamed Answer

---

## üí° Example Commands

### Slash Commands
```bash
/discover search query:"Inception" year:2010
/media recent
/manage addmovie tmdb_id:12345
/prefs add key:"likes.genres" value:"thriller"
/utils ping
/ping
```

### Natural Language
```
@MovieBot "What should we watch tonight?"
@MovieBot "Add The Matrix to my watchlist"
@MovieBot "Find me a thriller with Pedro Pascal"
@MovieBot "Show me my unwatched movies from 2023"
```

---

## ‚ö° Performance & Reliability

- **Caching** ‚Äî short‚Äëlived TTL caches (typically 30‚Äì120s; configurable)  
- **Bounded parallelism** ‚Äî configurable per family via `config.tools.parallelism` (default 4)  
- **Circuit breaker & retries** ‚Äî isolates failures and backs off automatically  
- **Hedged requests** ‚Äî selective backup requests (e.g., TMDb reads) to reduce tail latency  
- **Deduplication** ‚Äî request coalescing + result caching to avoid redundant calls  
- **Monitoring** ‚Äî built‚Äëin benchmarking and tracing utilities  
- **Configurable timeouts** ‚Äî sensible defaults with per‚Äëtool overrides  

---

## üß™ Testing

MovieBot includes both **unit tests** (fast, mocked) and **integration tests** (live services).

**Run unit tests:**
```bash
pytest tests/ -v -m "not integration"
```

**Run integration tests:**
```bash
pytest tests/ -v -m "integration"
```

**With coverage:**
```bash
pytest tests/ -v --cov=bot --cov=integrations --cov=config --cov-report=term-missing
```

---

## üìä Performance Benchmarking

MovieBot includes a comprehensive performance benchmarking tool that measures response times across all integrations and agent operations.

### Running Benchmarks

**Full benchmark suite:**
```bash
python scripts/benchmark_performance.py
```

**Agent-only benchmarks:**
```bash
python scripts/benchmark_performance.py --agent-only
```

**Custom thresholds:**
```bash
python scripts/benchmark_performance.py --agent-simple-threshold 45 --agent-complex-threshold 90
```

### Expected Performance

- Sub-second service calls for most metadata operations (Plex/Radarr/Sonarr/TMDb)
- End-to-end agent answers usually in 10‚Äì25s depending on query complexity
- Parallel batches yield noticeable speedups on multi-step discovery flows

### Benchmark Options

```bash
# Service-specific benchmarks
python scripts/benchmark_performance.py --plex-only
python scripts/benchmark_performance.py --radarr-only
python scripts/benchmark_performance.py --sonarr-only
python scripts/benchmark_performance.py --tmdb-only

# Custom iterations and thresholds
python scripts/benchmark_performance.py --iterations 5 --threshold 500
python scripts/benchmark_performance.py --agent-simple-threshold 30 --agent-complex-threshold 60

# Skip specific test categories
python scripts/benchmark_performance.py --skip-connectivity --skip-metadata
```

## üêõ Debugging & Performance Analysis

### trace_agent.py

When MovieBot isn't behaving as expected, `trace_agent.py` is your best friend for understanding what's happening under the hood. This debugging tool runs the agent once and captures a detailed trace of every step, tool call, and decision.

### benchmark_performance.py

For performance analysis and optimization, use the comprehensive benchmarking tool to measure response times across all services and identify bottlenecks.

### Usage
```bash
# Basic usage with default message
python scripts/trace_agent.py

# Custom message
python scripts/trace_agent.py --message "Find me a thriller with Pedro Pascal"

# Pretty-print the final response
python scripts/trace_agent.py --message "Show me my unwatched movies" --pretty

# Limit trace output (useful for long-running queries)
python scripts/trace_agent.py --max-events 50
```

### What You'll See

The trace shows you:
- **Agent planning** ‚Äî how the agent breaks down your request
- **Tool execution** ‚Äî which APIs are called and how long they take
- **LLM reasoning** ‚Äî the model's decision-making process
- **Phase transitions** ‚Äî read-only vs write operations
- **Performance metrics** ‚Äî timing for each operation

### Example Trace Output

Here's what a complex compound query looks like:

```bash
$ python scripts/trace_agent.py --message "Show me all the horror movies in my Plex library from 2020-2023, sorted by rating, and tell me which ones I haven't watched yet"

Running your library search and filters now ‚Äî here are the horror movies from 2020‚Äì2023 in your Plex, sorted by rating (I checked Plex for watched status too):

- No results found for Horror movies between 2020‚Äì2023 in your Plex [Plex]

If you expected titles from 2020‚Äì2023 to appear, would you like me to:
- broaden the year range (e.g., 2018‚Äì2023), or
- search for related genres (thriller/psychological) or specific titles to add?
```

### Why It's Super Useful

- **Performance debugging** ‚Äî see exactly which API calls are slow
- **Logic flow** ‚Äî understand how the agent interprets complex requests
- **Error isolation** ‚Äî pinpoint where things go wrong
- **Optimization** ‚Äî identify redundant or inefficient operations
- **Development** ‚Äî verify new features work as expected

Perfect for troubleshooting why a query didn't return expected results or why it's taking longer than usual.
